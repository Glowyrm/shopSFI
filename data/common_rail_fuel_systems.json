    "description":"High-pressure common-rail injection technology has revolutionized the diesel industry. Over the last decade, it has allowed engine builders to run higher injection pressures (as much as 29,000 psi in the new LML Duramax and 6.7L Power Stroke) in order to increase efficiency, while greatly reducing emissions. Use of the common-rail system has also facilitated multiple injection events (making diesels quieter). The icing on the cake is that these cleaner-burning engines make much more power than their predecessors.",
